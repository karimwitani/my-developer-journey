## What is SPNEGO

## What is a block cipher?

A block cipher is a cryptographic algorithm that encrypts and decrypts data in blocks of usualy the same size. They scramble
plaintext in blocks of ciphertext of the same size which are then combined to produce the
final encrypted message.

They use a key to convert the plaintext into cyphertext that can't be easily decrypted without that key.

Common ciphers are :

- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
- Triples DES (3DES)
- Blowfish

An important feature of block ciphers is that they can be used in many mode of operations:

- Electronic Codebook (ECB)
- Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
- Counter (CTR)
